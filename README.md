# Elena's Website 

![EP logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zelenkis/elenas-website/main/src/assets/images/favicon.png)

This is my first responsive [portfolio website](https://zelenkis.github.io/elenas-website) and it was built with [Angular v11.2](https://angular.io/) and [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and it is hosted on Github Pages.



## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
